## Introduction
As one might be aware, the P=NP problem is an open problem within the field of mathematics. Unfortunately, I am not a mathematician; I am a software engineer. What does it mean to be a software engineer?
Every software engineer writes code, but not all software engineers can write code of equal quality. How do you measure the quality of code in software engineers?

Oh boy...how much time do you got? That is a loaded question.

If you have all the time in the world, I suggest reading the history of mathematics. If you, like me, have a limited amount of time on this planet, you would probably want a short cut.

From a layman's perspective, high quality code might be described as "It worked."

From a software developer's perspective, high quality code might be described as "It looks pretty and it works the way we expect it to."

From a software engineer's perspective, high quality code might be described as "It looks pretty, it works the way we expect it to, and it performs it copmletes in a reasonable amount of time."

From a social perspective, high quality code might be described as "It has a net positive impact on society as we know it."

From a ruling class perspective, high quality code might be described as "It helps me get the things I want from the world."

From a working class perspective, high quality code might be described as "It teaches me how to move up in the world so that I can provide a better future for both myself and my future family despite the shitty hand that I was dealt at birth."

To conclude the introduction, your identity in relation to software affects your judgement on whether or not code is to be considered "high quality" or "low quality."

## Section 1: Setting the Scene
### How do you view code?
We as coders, programmers, hackers, and anyone who works with computers (including white-collared workers, students, and blue-collared workers not in the field) view code in the same way: using a screen.
Have you ever thought about what a screen is?

I own many screens. I have a Macbook Pro gifted to me by my so, so, so generous parents who have bestowed upon me the gift of privilege and the gift of uncondtional love back in December of 2014. 
I have a Macbook Pro that I bought for myself this past year, back in May of 2021 that I am paying off using an Apple Credit card since they offered a 0% interest rate for a $2,000+ machine (the thought process is that if I'm going to dish out $2,000+ eventually, but I don't need to do so right away, I mind as well keep the money in my pockets rather than Apple's pockets just in case I need it for a rainy day.

The approach I took when buying this new machine is the same approach that my parents used to buy my first car back in 2000. Given that I was 2 at the time, so it wasn't "mine" until I learned how to drive, and even then, it legally wasn't "mine" since my name was never on the registration. Anyways though, back when they bought a 2000 Ford Expedition, the interest rates for keeping your money in the bank were higher than the interest rates required to receive an auto-loan. For this reason, despite typically desiring the avoidance of "going into debt," my parents knew that going into debt to buy the car would benefit them in the long run. That is, it would be "cheaper" to get an auto-loan than to buy a car outright.

Anyways, I digress.

## Section 2: Buying a TV
### How do you choose a TV when you go to the store?
Costco, BestBuy, and Target are typically where I see the most TVs on display. They are getting cheaper and bigger nowadays compared to when I was younger. I remember having this big clunky TV back in the early 2000's where my brother and I would watch shows. Some of my favorites were Danny Phantom, The Suite Life of Zack and Cody, The Suite Life on Deck, Drake and Josh, iCarly, Totally Spies, among many, many others.

Back then, I'm pretty sure the TVs were called "tube TVs" with plasma TVs and flat screen TVs. Nowadays, screens use a whole bunch of different techonolgies to increase the quality of color perception that the screen emits to the viewers. The organizations responsible for pushing the technology behind TVs forwards seem to repeat a few common behaviors: make TVs cheaper, try to sell more TVs, increase the quality of color, increase the density of pixels within the screen.

The use a few cheap tricks to do so. To make TVs cheaper, they put a price tag with a smaller number on the TV. To sell more TVs, they use marketing tricks such as measuring the diagonal of the TV (so a that is 3 inches wide and 4 inches tall would be labeled as a 5 inch TV (using Pythagoras's Theorem). To increase the quality of color, they develop new techniques such as [today's selction at Walmart ](https://www.walmart.com/cp/tv-video/1060825) having a choice of QLED, OLED, LED, LCD, and NanoCell TVs. They all perform the same function, being able to display a picture or motion picture like your favorite TV show or your favorite movie (mine are The Big Bang Theory and Silicon Valley despite not having watch either in their entirety. They remain my favorite because those shows consistently make me laugh despite the corny jokes). To increase the density of pixels within the screen, they must experiment with new technologies to see which ones result in denser pixel count. Either that or they lie about how many pixels their TVs have (a 4K TV has a 3840 x 2160 pixels resolution and a "high definition" resolution has 1280 x 720 pixels yet for whatever reason, "Full HD" resolution has 1920Ã—1080 pixels).
The point is, there is no standard for what determines the price of a TV.

As someone who buys TVs, I don't really care about this crap. I want a TV that looks good enough and is the right size for cheap. So when I recently went to Best Buy, they had 60" TVs for about $500 and then 70" TVs for aboput $750. For me, I did not think a TV that was 10 inches bigger on the diagonal was worth 50% more money. I could buy two 60" TVs for the same price as two 70" TVs!

In conclusion, buying a TV is an incredibly complex task, and there is not correct answer.

### How do you choose a TV for your small business waiting room? Like the ones at the doctors' offices where they display things.

You don't. 

You buy a digital sign. You see, digital signs and TVs still perform the same function, the only different being that digial signs were made with "high quality components" where as TVs are made with cheap ones. Digital signs were designed to be on nearly 24/7, 52 weeks per year for many, many years.

TVs were designed to be watched no more than few hours a day because it is expected that the owner of the TV will only watch the TV a few hours a day. If a small business owner purchases a TV instead of a digital sign, they should expect the TV to last about a year, and so then in the long run, they will pay more cash for a series of TVs than they do for a singular digital sign.

### How do you choose a TV for your big corporation?

You don't. 

Your big corporation does not simply buy a TV. First, they must figure out how many TVs they need for all of their offices and satellite offices. Second, they must figure out which TV to buy that will help their bottom line (one that allows them to profit as much as possible in the long run). Then, because they plan on buying multiple TVs, they must enter negotiations with a vendor who sells TVs in order to find a price point that they deem fair. Before that, they need to FIND a vendor. Before that, they need to know someone who knows a TV vendor.
Later on, after negotations are complete, then they must get the okay from the person whose job it is to buy the TVs. Then they need to let accounting know that they are about to spend X amount of dollars. Then they go back to the vendor, give them the dollars, and receive ownership of the TVs.

After that, the big corporation needs to figure out the logistics behind making sure that they are able to bring the TV to wherever the TV is suppose to go. They need to contact the people who are going to install the TVs, and find a way to get the TVs to the right location. They could theoretically hire a third-party to deliver and install the TVs, but if that was not considered at the very beginning when they were picking a TV to help them profit, then they must figure out the internal logistics of installing all the TVs that they just bought.

The question remains: who within the company decided that it was time to buy a set of TVs? Was it the CEO? Was it someone with access to the company's line of credit who bought the TV on a whim? Was it their consumers who want to buy TVs because this big corporation is actually just a TV store? How does a TV store figure out how many TVs to buy?

As you can tell, choosing a TV for your big corporation is a complex task.

Even if you change buying a TV to buying a digital sign, the task remains just as complex.

Even if you are a software company whose value lies in the hands of your software engineers, and you don't need to buy TVs or digital signs but rather you need to buy monitors, the task remains just as complex.

## Section 3: Revisiting Grammar
### Capital Letters
The letters that should be capitalized in order for a piece of writing to be considered to be "proper grammer" by the English language according to my recollection of what was taught to me in school are the following: proper nouns, the first letter of the first word of a sentence, whichever random ass letters in people's names that they decide should be capitalized (for example McElroy).

### Articles
The articles considered to be "proper grammer" by the English language according to my recollection of what was taught to me in school are the following: a, an, the.

The article "a" signifies that the noun following it is not unique. A zebra is not special, and you would have no idea which zebra someone is talking about if they said "I need you to give a zebra in Africa a bath" but they actually meant Marty the Zebra in Madagascar, I would speculate the chances of your giving a bath to the zebra that the speaker meant is right around 0%, especially since you likely wouldn't even go to Madagascar when you go to Africa.

The article "an" is the same as the article "a," denoting a noun that is not unique
