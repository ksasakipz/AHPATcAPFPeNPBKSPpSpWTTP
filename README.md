## Mission Statement
Harvey Mudd College seeks to educate engineers, scientists and mathematicians well-versed in all of these areas and in the humanities and the social sciences so that they may assume leadership in their fields with a clear understanding of the impact of their work on society

## Introduction
As one might be aware, the P=NP problem is an open problem within the field of mathematics. Unfortunately, I am not a mathematician; I am a software engineer. What does it mean to be a software engineer?
Every software engineer writes code, but not all software engineers can write code of equal quality. How do you measure the quality of code in software engineers?

Oh boy...how much time do you got? That is a loaded question.

If you have all the time in the world, I suggest reading the history of mathematics. If you, like me, have a limited amount of time on this planet, you would probably want a short cut.

From a layman's perspective, high quality code might be described as "It worked."

From a software developer's perspective, high quality code might be described as "It looks pretty and it works the way we expect it to."

From a software engineer's perspective, high quality code might be described as "It looks pretty, it works the way we expect it to, and it performs it copmletes in a reasonable amount of time."

From a social perspective, high quality code might be described as "It has a net positive impact on society as we know it."

From a ruling class perspective, high quality code might be described as "It helps me get the things I want from the world."

From a working class perspective, high quality code might be described as "It teaches me how to move up in the world so that I can provide a better future for both myself and my future family despite the shitty hand that I was dealt at birth."

To conclude the introduction, your identity in relation to software affects your judgement on whether or not code is to be considered "high quality" or "low quality."
