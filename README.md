## Mission Statement
Harvey Mudd College seeks to educate engineers, scientists and mathematicians well-versed in all of these areas and in the humanities and the social sciences so that they may assume leadership in their fields with a clear understanding of the impact of their work on society
Kevin Sasaki seeeks to reproduce and redistribute privilege, to a reasonable extent of course


## Introduction
As one might be aware, the P=NP problem is an open problem within the field of mathematics. Unfortunately, I am not a mathematician; I am a software engineer. What does it mean to be a software engineer?
Every software engineer writes code, but not all software engineers can write code of equal quality. How do you measure the quality of code in software engineers?

Oh boy...how much time do you got? That is a loaded question.

If you have all the time in the world, I suggest reading the history of mathematics. If you, like me, have a limited amount of time on this planet, you would probably want a short cut.

From a layman's perspective, high quality code might be described as "It worked."

From a software developer's perspective, high quality code might be described as "It looks pretty and it works the way we expect it to."

From a software engineer's perspective, high quality code might be described as "It looks pretty, it works the way we expect it to, and it performs it copmletes in a reasonable amount of time."

From a social perspective, high quality code might be described as "It has a net positive impact on society as we know it."

From a ruling class perspective, high quality code might be described as "It helps me get the things I want from the world."

From a working class perspective, high quality code might be described as "It teaches me how to move up in the world so that I can provide a better future for both myself and my future family despite the shitty hand that I was dealt at birth."

To conclude the introduction, your identity in relation to software affects your judgement on whether or not code is to be considered "high quality" or "low quality."

## A Little Background
### How do you view code?
We as coders, programmers, hackers, and anyone who works with computers (including white-collared workers, students, and blue-collared workers not in the field) view code in the same way: using a screen.
Have you ever thought about what a screen is?

I own many screens. I have a Macbook Pro gifted to me by my so, so, so generous parents who have bestowed upon me the gift of privilege and the gift of uncondtional love back in December of 2014. 
I have a Macbook Pro that I bought for myself this past year, back in May of 2021 that I am paying off using an Apple Credit card since they offered a 0% interest rate for a $2,000+ machine (the thought process is that if I'm going to dish out $2,000+ eventually, but I don't need to do so right away, I mind as well keep the money in my pockets rather than Apple's pockets just in case I need it for a rainy day.

The approach I took when buying this new machine is the same approach that my parents used to buy my first car back in 2000. Given that I was 2 at the time, so it wasn't "mine" until I learned how to drive, and even then, it legally wasn't "mine" since my name was never on the registration. Anyways though, back when they bought a 2000 Ford Expedition, the interest rates for keeping your money in the bank were higher than the interest rates required to receive an auto-loan. For this reason, despite typically desiring the avoidance of "going into debt," my parents knew that going into debt to buy the car would benefit them in the long run. That is, it would be "cheaper" to get an auto-loan than to buy a car outright.

Anyways, I digress.

### How do you choose a TV when you go to the store?
Costco, BestBuy, and Target are typically where I see the most TVs on display. They are getting cheaper and bigger nowadays compared to when I was younger. I remember having this big clunky TV back in the early 2000's where my brother and I would watch shows. Some of my favorites were Danny Phantom, The Suite Life of Zack and Cody, The Suite Life on Deck, Drake and Josh, iCarly, Totally Spies, among many, many others.

Back then, I'm pretty sure the TVs were called "tube TVs" with plasma TVs and flat screen TVs. Nowadays, screens use a whole bunch of different techonolgies to increase the quality of color perception that the screen emits to the viewers. The organizations responsible for pushing the technology behind TVs forwards seem to repeat a few common behaviors: make TVs cheaper, try to sell more TVs, increase the quality of color, increase the density of pixels within the screen.

The use a few cheap tricks to do so. To make TVs cheaper, they put a price tag with a smaller number on the TV. To sell more TVs, they use marketing tricks such as measuring the diagonal of the TV (so a that is 3 inches wide and 4 inches tall would be labeled as a 5 inch TV (using Pythagoras's Theorem). To increase the quality of color, they develop new techniques such as [today's selction at Walmart ](https://www.walmart.com/cp/tv-video/1060825) having a choice of QLED, OLED, LED, LCD, and NanoCell TVs. They all perform the same function, being able to display a picture or motion picture like your favorite TV show or your favorite movie (mine are The Big Bang Theory and Silicon Valley despite not having watch either in their entirety. They remain my favorite because those shows consistently make me laugh despite the corny jokes).
